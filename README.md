### Structured SOC Workflow Framework (In Development)

SecFlow is a structured SOC workflow framework designed to help junior analysts and cybersecurity students think and operate like real security professionals.

This project focuses on building a clear analytical process rather than just running tools.

Capture → Scan → Analyze → Summarize → Recommend

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of SecFlow is to bridge the gap between:

- Learning security tools
- Understanding analytical reasoning
- Explaining findings clearly in interviews
- Thinking in structured investigation phases

SecFlow is being developed as both:

- A hands-on training framework
- A guided thinking model for junior SOC analysts

## 🧠 Core Concept

Instead of focusing only on commands (Nmap, traffic capture, etc.),  
SecFlow emphasizes:

- Structured workflow thinking  
- Risk-oriented interpretation  
- Clear summary writing  
- Actionable recommendations  
- Interview-ready explanation skills  

The project is centered around building analytical discipline.

## 🎤 Interview Preparation Value

SecFlow is designed to help junior analysts explain:

- Why certain scans are performed  
- What open ports really mean  
- How to evaluate exposure  
- How to classify risk  
- What a SOC analyst would recommend next  

It trains reasoning — not memorization.

## 🛠 Development Focus

Current development phase:

- Workflow architecture stabilization  
- Risk interpretation modeling  
- Structured output design  
- Report layer planning  

This repository intentionally presents the conceptual framework  
while core implementation logic remains private.
## 🚀 Vision

SecFlow aims to evolve into a structured SOC training assistant  
that helps analysts move from executing tools  
to thinking like security professionals.
